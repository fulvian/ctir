### Fixed
- CTIR Proxy OpenRouter response shape now matches Anthropic Messages schema

- Launcher scripts enforce proxy correctly for Claude CLI
  - Use `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001` (and keep `ANTHROPIC_API_URL` for compatibility)
  - Updated: `start-ctir-claude.sh`, `start-claude-ctir.sh`, `start-claude-ctir-only.sh`, `start-ctir-final.sh`, `start-ctir-proxy-only.sh`, `start-ctir-simple.sh`, `quick-start.sh`, `setup-claude-ctir.sh`, `claude-logout.sh`, `claude-clean-token.sh`
- Start script and proxy stability improvements
  - Resolved CLI crash on fallback responses and improved routing logs

  - Corrected read command syntax for better bash compatibility
  - Improved error handling in cleanup section

### Known Issues
- None currently tracked for proxy routing. If Claude CLI still bypasses CTIR,
  verify `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` is set in the CLI shell and that `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is unset there.

### Session Monitoring Oscillation Fix (Critical Issue Resolution)

**Problem**: The Claude Code session monitoring system was experiencing persistent oscillation between fallback activation and reset, causing infinite loops and making logs unusable.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Flag `isLimitDetectedAndWaitingForReset` was set but never properly reset
- System continued re-reading the same log content containing limit messages
- Generic polling every 5 minutes was inefficient and unreliable

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Flag Reset Logic**: Added explicit flag reset in both precise timer and polling fallback paths
2. **Deterministic Parsing**: Implemented regex patterns to extract exact reset timestamps from limit messages
3. **Precise Timer**: Replaced polling with setTimeout-based scheduling (30-second buffer before reset)
4. **Granular Logging**: Added comprehensive debug logging for troubleshooting
5. **Robust Fallback**: Maintained polling as fallback if timestamp extraction fails

**Technical Details**:
- Enhanced regex patterns support multiple time formats: "resets at 5pm", "come back at 3:30pm", etc.
- Timer precision: 30-second buffer before actual reset time
- Logging includes: flag state, log positions, detection counts, reset times, error details
- Fallback mechanism ensures system remains functional even if parsing fails

**Files Modified**:
- `src/core/claude-monitor.ts`: Core monitoring logic with flag reset and precise timing
- `CHANGELOG.md`: Documentation of the fix and technical details
