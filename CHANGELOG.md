### Session Monitoring Oscillation Fix (Critical Issue Resolution)

**Problem**: The Claude Code session monitoring system was experiencing persistent oscillation between fallback activation and reset, causing infinite loops and making logs unusable.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Flag `isLimitDetectedAndWaitingForReset` was set but never properly reset
- System continued re-reading the same log content containing limit messages
- Generic polling every 5 minutes was inefficient and unreliable

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Flag Reset Logic**: Added explicit flag reset in both precise timer and polling fallback paths
2. **Deterministic Parsing**: Implemented regex patterns to extract exact reset timestamps from limit messages
3. **Precise Timer**: Replaced polling with setTimeout-based scheduling (30-second buffer before reset)
4. **Granular Logging**: Added comprehensive debug logging for troubleshooting
5. **Robust Fallback**: Maintained polling as fallback if timestamp extraction fails

**Technical Details**:
- Enhanced regex patterns support multiple time formats: "resets at 5pm", "come back at 3:30pm", etc.
- Timer precision: 30-second buffer before actual reset time
- Logging includes: flag state, log positions, detection counts, reset times, error details
- Fallback mechanism ensures system remains functional even if parsing fails

**Files Modified**:
- `src/core/claude-monitor.ts`: Core monitoring logic with flag reset and precise timing
- `CHANGELOG.md`: Documentation of the fix and technical details
